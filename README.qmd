# Preface

This [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) document contains the code presented in our manuscript TBD (TBD). You can download and run it in RStudio to reproduce the analyses in our manuscript.

# R environment

First, ensure that your current working directory contains both the analysis script and the data file. If you use RStudio, the easiest thing to do is to open up the relevant R Project (`deception-sdt.Rproj`) in RStudio.

Then, make sure that you have the required R packages installed. We have used [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/collaborating.html) to ensure that you can install and use the exact same versions of the packages. To install those packages (you only need to do this once), execute `renv::restore()` in the R console.

You can now load the required packages

```{r}
library(brms) # Bayesian modelling
library(emmeans) # Model summaries
library(tidyverse) # Data wrangling and plotting

```
